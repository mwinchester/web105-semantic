            <h2>What should I learn?</h2>
            <p>You probably should have a basic understanding of all the approaches. You don't need to actually try creating a page in the old Table based layouts, you are unlikely to see those anymore. You should understand the floating and naming system of the CSS layout. The semantic sections should be kept even when using a grid layout, and a basic understanding of how to use floats will probably be useful for at least the next few years.</p>
            <p>That being said, I would tend towards using a freamework to do most development. They are grid based and include powerful CSS and JavaScript libraries that you can leverage to significantly decrease development time. </p>

                <h2>Where we Have Been</h2>
                <p>In the beginning of web development, programmers were the first web designers because you needed to know how to code to be able to make a web page. The HTML language was based upon Standard Generalized Markup Language, a language used for layout and formatting in Word Processors. That worked pretty well, you could left, center, and right alighn and do some color and font foramatting.</p>
                <p>Soon designers got into the mix, and discovered that you could completely control layout using tables. You could set the table borders to be invisible, and if you needed to break down the page any further, you could put tables inside the cells of other tables.</p>
